ZeroPlane
=========

ZeroPlane is a plugin for [X-Plane](http://www.x-plane.com/) that allows developers to communicate with X-Plane.
It uses [Protocol Buffers](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) to serialize structured objects, and [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/)
to transfer them.
Clients can be written in any language and for any platform that supports these frameworks.

An example python client implementation is provided.
